For my 4.4 section I make a light detector, which means the keyboard will print relative messages according to the brightness. 
In the code, I set different keys for the keyboard:
key="So dark! I am so scare!!!\n"
key1 =  "dim!\n"
key2="lighter now!\n"
key3="My eyes!!!My eyes!!!!?\n"

So in the while loop I will make the chip detect the brightness, and keyboard will type messages according to the brightness(for example, "So dark! I am so scare" when brightness is very low).
